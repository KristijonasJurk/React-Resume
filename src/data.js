From the first lines of JS code, I knew, that Front-End is the way to go. Perhaps, it is because I have experience working as a CAD designer, where details are the main priority. Or the experience I gained writing CNC code at a manufacturing company, where the slightest mistake could have consequences up to thousands of euros. Nevertheless, currently I am looking for a web developer internship. In the meantime, I am learning React. Interesting fact, this website was my first React project."
