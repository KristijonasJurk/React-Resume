Since, finishing my Mechanical Engineering studies and working in the tech sector(CAD designing, CNC programming etc.), I have decided to pursue programming. Recently I finished a 6 month long Full-Stack developer course at the Baltic Institute of Technology (BIT), which gave me a great start. At this time, I invest most of my time learning the React library. For this reason I would value working experience using this library, but of course I am flexible and willing to learn new concepts. Finally, I have excellent English skills (C1 level) and I am motivated, persistent and talkative"
